###### Internal Tech/ Structure

# Notice
* Please know that this is a proof of concept and was really created so that I could familiarize myself with different technologies that I liked more (Typescript vs Vanila Js, MongoDB vs PostgreSQL)
* I will upload this project whenever I get some stable DB clusters and a place to host the main files
* Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns
