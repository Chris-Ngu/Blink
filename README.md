### Known Bugs
###### Internal Tech/ Structure
* Connect PostgreSQL backend from Heroku

###### Login Screen
* 'Forgot Password' animation catching on itself
* Create registration queries (Create 3 submit functions or create just 1; also handle input, might be already done with component input validation)

###### Landing Page
* Hero image/ video? Thanks @JohnsonTran :)

# Notice
* Please know that this is a proof of concept and was really created so that I could familiarize myself with different technologies that I liked more (Typescript vs Vanila Js, MongoDB vs PostgreSQL)
* I will upload this project whenever I get some stable DB clusters and a place to host the main files
* Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns
